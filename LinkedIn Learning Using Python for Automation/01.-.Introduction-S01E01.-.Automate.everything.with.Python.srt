00:00:00,03 --> 00:00:02,05
- [Sam] Automation is the major driver

2
00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:06,00
of our modern economy, because it allows individuals

3
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:09,09
to be more productive than ever while using fewer resources.

4
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:13,00
And as technology continues to reshape modern business,

5
00:00:13,00 --> 00:00:15,09
more and more tasks can now be automated,

6
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:18,09
and automating processes doesn't have to be hard,

7
00:00:18,09 --> 00:00:21,01
if you're using the right tools,

8
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:23,01
and this where Python comes in.

9
00:00:23,01 --> 00:00:25,09
Python is an easy to learn programming language

10
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:28,04
that you can use to build automations.

11
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:29,04
And because Python

12
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:31,08
is the fastest growing programming language,

13
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:35,00
new tools are being developed and added every day.

14
00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:38,03
My name is Sam Pettus, and I use programming languages

15
00:00:38,03 --> 00:00:41,05
like Python to help businesses and individuals

16
00:00:41,05 --> 00:00:43,09
solve problems and save time.

17
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:45,04
In this course, I'll introduce you

18
00:00:45,04 --> 00:00:47,00
to some of the interesting ways

19
00:00:47,00 --> 00:00:49,08
Python can automate computer operations.

20
00:00:49,08 --> 00:00:52,04
We'll take a look at how to click and type on websites,

21
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:55,04
interact with APIs, web script datasets,

22
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:58,05
and automate file and terminal interactions and more.

23
00:00:58,05 --> 00:01:00,00
By the end of this course you'll understand

24
00:01:00,00 --> 00:01:02,05
the many ways Python can automate tasks,

25
00:01:02,05 --> 00:01:05,04
and feel confident constructing these automations yourself.

26
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:08,00
So, if you're excited about compiling your own army

27
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:11,00
of automated robots, let's go ahead and get started.
