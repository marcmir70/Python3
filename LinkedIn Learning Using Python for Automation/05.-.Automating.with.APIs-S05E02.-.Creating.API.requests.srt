00:00:00,02 --> 00:00:01,04
- [Instructor] Let's check out the first step

2
00:00:01,04 --> 00:00:04,03
of using APIs, creating the request.

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:06,04
To practice, we'll be using this free API

4
00:00:06,04 --> 00:00:09,02
on upcitemdb.com.

5
00:00:09,02 --> 00:00:10,07
This software translates barcodes

6
00:00:10,07 --> 00:00:12,04
into a whole host of information,

7
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:16,04
including the product's name and brand.

8
00:00:16,04 --> 00:00:19,00
To see an example of what an API call should look like,

9
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:22,03
let's go ahead and use their online GUI I've pulled up here.

10
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:27,07
To demo, I'll just use a LaCroix can barcode.

11
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:29,07
This is a lot of information to break down.

12
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:30,06
But for now,

13
00:00:30,06 --> 00:00:35,06
let's just focus at the request URL line at the top.

14
00:00:35,06 --> 00:00:37,07
This line contains two factors,

15
00:00:37,07 --> 00:00:40,08
the base URL, or everything preceding the question mark,

16
00:00:40,08 --> 00:00:42,07
and the parameters of the API call,

17
00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:45,07
or everything after the question mark.

18
00:00:45,07 --> 00:00:48,01
The base URL is independent of our parameters

19
00:00:48,01 --> 00:00:51,01
and will be the same for any barcode we'll look up.

20
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:52,06
However, on the other hand,

21
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:56,00
the parameters are specific to this barcode search.

22
00:00:56,00 --> 00:00:57,01
This may sounds complex

23
00:00:57,01 --> 00:00:59,05
but this breaks down very simply into code.

24
00:00:59,05 --> 00:01:00,07
Let me show you.

25
00:01:00,07 --> 00:01:04,01
Let's start by constructing the base URL for our API call.

26
00:01:04,01 --> 00:01:13,03
Just go ahead and copy the URL preceding the question mark.

27
00:01:13,03 --> 00:01:16,01
Now I'll need to construct the parameters for the API call.

28
00:01:16,01 --> 00:01:18,07
This is done by making a Python dictionary.

29
00:01:18,07 --> 00:01:20,00
To structure this dictionary,

30
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:20,08
let's take a look

31
00:01:20,08 --> 00:01:23,07
at the information after the question mark.

32
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:24,09
From the highlighted text,

33
00:01:24,09 --> 00:01:28,05
you can see UPC is equal to our LaCroix barcode.

34
00:01:28,05 --> 00:01:29,09
So in our dictionary,

35
00:01:29,09 --> 00:01:37,06
UPC should be the key and the barcode our value.

36
00:01:37,06 --> 00:01:38,08
With the bases covered,

37
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:41,05
it's time to actually invoke the API call.

38
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:42,04
To do this,

39
00:01:42,04 --> 00:01:43,04
I'll use the request library

40
00:01:43,04 --> 00:01:45,04
which allows us to send our GET query

41
00:01:45,04 --> 00:01:57,00
containing the parameters and our base URL.

42
00:01:57,00 --> 00:02:00,01
To make sure our API request was properly constructed,

43
00:02:00,01 --> 00:02:08,09
let's go ahead and print out its responses URL attribute.

44
00:02:08,09 --> 00:02:10,01
Comparing to the demos,

45
00:02:10,01 --> 00:02:12,06
you can see we've made an exact match.

46
00:02:12,06 --> 00:02:13,05
And, with that,

47
00:02:13,05 --> 00:02:16,00
you've constructed your first request to an API.
