1
00:00:00,02 --> 00:00:02,04
So why automate web browsing?

2
00:00:02,04 --> 00:00:05,01
Well, there's really just two main purposes.

3
00:00:05,01 --> 00:00:07,03
The first and more prominent reason,

4
00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:09,05
is to test website functionality,

5
00:00:09,05 --> 00:00:13,02
Automating testing decreases the cost and time,

6
00:00:13,02 --> 00:00:16,03
while also providing a means of round the clock testing.

7
00:00:16,03 --> 00:00:19,02
Additionally, it makes cross-browser proofing easier.

8
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:21,08
The second and less discussed application,

9
00:00:21,08 --> 00:00:24,00
is Botting Processes online.

10
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,01
Botting is defined as a piece of software

11
00:00:26,01 --> 00:00:29,03
that executes commands or performs routine tasks

12
00:00:29,03 --> 00:00:31,06
without the users intervention.

13
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:34,09
And this can be applied to any repetitive task online.

14
00:00:34,09 --> 00:00:36,09
For example, let's say you order take-out

15
00:00:36,09 --> 00:00:38,06
everyday from a website.

16
00:00:38,06 --> 00:00:41,08
Well, instead of manually filling out the form each time,

17
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:44,03
you can instead script the entire process.

18
00:00:44,03 --> 00:00:46,07
Or perhaps, logging into a certain website

19
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:49,00
or email, becomes a tedious task.

20
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:50,03
Just script it.

21
00:00:50,03 --> 00:00:53,01
Any repetitive online task can now be optimized

22
00:00:53,01 --> 00:00:55,00
by creating a Python script.

23
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:57,07
However, these examples just represent benevolent

24
00:00:57,07 --> 00:00:58,09
botting tasks.

25
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:01,00
Conversely, this tool can be used for much more

26
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:02,05
nefarious purposes.

27
00:01:02,05 --> 00:01:03,07
One of the biggest issues

28
00:01:03,07 --> 00:01:06,03
is Botting Limited Quantity Items.

29
00:01:06,03 --> 00:01:08,05
Tickets to shows or exclusive merchandise

30
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:09,08
are good examples.

31
00:01:09,08 --> 00:01:11,09
Normally the check out process appears fair.

32
00:01:11,09 --> 00:01:13,08
As everyone must go through similar steps

33
00:01:13,08 --> 00:01:15,06
before a product sells out.

34
00:01:15,06 --> 00:01:18,00
But automation creates an unfair arena.

35
00:01:18,00 --> 00:01:20,09
Scripts can navigate websites significantly faster

36
00:01:20,09 --> 00:01:23,05
than humans, and moreover, scripts can execute

37
00:01:23,05 --> 00:01:26,06
hundreds, if not thousands of requests at once.

38
00:01:26,06 --> 00:01:28,08
Nearly guaranteeing the process.

39
00:01:28,08 --> 00:01:31,03
Consequently, this makes botting notorious

40
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:33,04
for only being used for exploits.

41
00:01:33,04 --> 00:01:36,05
But as discussed before, there are positive purposes.

42
00:01:36,05 --> 00:01:38,04
All right, with that disclaimer out of the way,

43
00:01:38,04 --> 00:01:39,06
let's get you set up.

44
00:01:39,06 --> 00:01:41,06
We'll be using the Selenium Library to help

45
00:01:41,06 --> 00:01:43,03
us interact with the web.

46
00:01:43,03 --> 00:01:45,02
Go ahead and install it.

47
00:01:45,02 --> 00:01:47,09
Additionally, Selenium interfaces with the internet

48
00:01:47,09 --> 00:01:50,04
by using a web driver, which is a browser

49
00:01:50,04 --> 00:01:53,05
that Selenium can use to automate web processes.

50
00:01:53,05 --> 00:01:56,02
The two ones I recommend using are Chrome driver,

51
00:01:56,02 --> 00:01:58,06
which runs Google Chrome. Or gecko driver,

52
00:01:58,06 --> 00:02:00,01
which runs Firefox.

53
00:02:00,01 --> 00:02:03,01
So, select whichever browser you feel more comfortable

54
00:02:03,01 --> 00:02:05,09
with, and use a package installer to download

55
00:02:05,09 --> 00:02:07,06
either one of the drivers.

56
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:08,09
You don't need both.

57
00:02:08,09 --> 00:02:10,09
I'll be using Chrome driver and downloading it

58
00:02:10,09 --> 00:02:15,00
with the Home Brew package installer.

59
00:02:15,00 --> 00:02:17,00
With that setup, we're ready to begin coding.
