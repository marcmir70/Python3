# - ref: https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/19/07-list-comprehensions.html
# Exercise: Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
# concepts: List comprehensions, Randomic

import random

numlist = []
list_length = random.randint(5, 15)

while len(numlist) < list_length:
    numlist.append(random.randint(1, 75))

evenlist = [number for number in numlist if number % 2 == 0]

print(numlist)
print(evenlist)
