# Exercise: Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
# concepts: List comprehensions
# suggested reference: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = [number for number in a if number % 2 == 0]

print(b)
